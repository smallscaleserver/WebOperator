# AGENTS.md — WebOperator

Canonical agent-facing context for this repo. Read this first, before
README.md, when picking up work here — in Claude Code, Codex CLI, or any
other agent.

## What this project is

WebOperator is a universal browser-automation platform: it logs into Gmail
and arbitrary third-party websites, extracts data, and handles unexpected
events (popups, dialogs, expired sessions, CAPTCHA/2FA) — falling back to a
human operator through a live, controllable browser screen when it can't
resolve something itself. Full architecture narrative is in `README.md`.

## Current status

**Phase 1 (Prototype), in progress.** The Docker/noVNC browser scaffold
exists and works standalone; no application/worker code exists yet.

Run it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # first time only
docker compose up browser-worker-chrome   # or browser-worker-firefox
```

Open `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html` (Chrome) or `http://localhost:6081/vnc.html`
(Firefox), enter the VNC password from `.env`, and you get a real, clickable
desktop with the browser open — same idea as the `noVNC Manual Takeover`
screen described in the README's architecture.

Full checklist + decision log: [`docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`](./docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md).

## Working conventions (decided — don't re-litigate without reason)

- Project name is **WebOperator** only. Do not reintroduce the old
  "WebSteward" codename.
- Core application stack (once code starts beyond the Docker scaffold):
  TypeScript/Node.js + Playwright for browser automation, Redis + BullMQ for
  the task queue, PostgreSQL for task/account metadata, MinIO/S3 for
  screenshots/video/downloads. See decision log in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
- Both Chrome and Firefox must stay supported — this is not a Chrome-only
  tool.
- Never store plaintext credentials in source or `.env`. The `data/profiles/`
  bind mount is an explicitly-acknowledged dev-only shortcut until the
  encrypted Session Vault (Phase 2/3) exists — don't treat it as production
  storage.
- If you hit CAPTCHA/2FA/passkey handling, the answer is "stop and hand off
  to a human via the noVNC screen," not "try to bypass it."

## After making changes

Update the checklist in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` (tick items off, add new ones)
so the next session — in either tool — knows what's actually done.
